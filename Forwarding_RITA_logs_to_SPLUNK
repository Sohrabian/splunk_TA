Downlaod Link - 
https://github.com/activecm/rita-legacy/releases

Dwonlaod the :
  install.sh
Put it onto the zeek server and then :
  chmod +x install.sh
  or
  chmod 755 install.sh
Install via 
  sudo ./install.sh

-----------Data Rolling via RITA Command----
--------------------------------------------
the Meaning of this Command in RITA using chatGPT:
rita import --rolling --numchunks 48 /opt/zeek/logs/current 48-hour-dataset

The command rita import --rolling --numchunks 48 /opt/zeek/logs/current 48-hour-dataset 
is used to import log data into a specified dataset using the Rita tool, which is commonly
associated with analyzing Zeek (formerly known as Bro) logs. Below is a breakdown of the 
command and its components:
Command Breakdown

    rita import: This initiates the import process in Rita, which is designed to handle log data from Zeek.
    --rolling: This flag indicates that the import should be done in a rolling manner, which typically means
                that it will continuously check for new log entries and update the dataset accordingly. 
                This is useful for real-time data analysis.
    --numchunks 48: This option specifies that the import process should be divided into 48 chunks.
                    This can help optimize performance by allowing the system to manage memory and 
                    processing more efficiently, especially when dealing with large datasets.
    /opt/zeek/logs/current: This is the path to the directory containing the current logs generated by Zeek.
                            The logs in this directory are what will be imported into Rita.
    48-hour-dataset: This is the name of the dataset where the imported logs will be stored.
                    It suggests that this dataset will contain information relevant to a 48-hour period.

Usage Context
This command is particularly useful in environments where Zeek is deployed for network monitoring and security analysis.
By importing logs in chunks, users can efficiently manage large volumes of data without overwhelming system resources.
The rolling import feature allows for near real-time updates, making it easier to analyze ongoing network activities and incidents.
In summary, this command facilitates effective log management and analysis by leveraging Rita's capabilities to handle Zeek logs efficiently.

---------Installation of RITA---------------
--------------------------------------------
## Step 01- RITA Installation and Configuration 
rita import --rolling --numchunks 48 /opt/zeek/logs/current 48-hour-dataset

## Step 02- Splunk Integration with RITA 
1- apt-get install sshpass

2- mkdir /opt/csvlogs

3- nano /opt/RITA.sh

#! /bin/bash
rita import --rolling --numchunks 48 /opt/zeek/logs/current 48-hour-dataset 
rita show-beacons 48-hour-dataset > /opt/csvlogs/show-beacons.csv
rita show-beacons-proxy 48-hour-dataset > /opt/csvlogs/show-beacons-proxy.csv 
rita show-bl-dest-ips 48-hour-dataset > /opt/csvlogs/show-bl-dest-ips.csv 
rita show-bl-source-ips 48-hour-dataset > /opt/csvlogs/show-bl-source-ips.csv 
rita show-exploded-dns 48-hour-dataset > /opt/csvlogs/show-exploded-dns.csv 
rita show-open-connections 48-hour-dataset > /opt/csvlogs/show-open-connections.csv  
rita show-useragents 48-hour-dataset > /opt/csvlogs/show-useragents.csv  
rita show-beacons-sni 48-hour-dataset > /opt/csvlogs/show-beacons-sni.csv  
rita show-bl-hostnames 48-hour-dataset > /opt/csvlogs/show-bl-hostnames.csv  
rita show-long-connections 48-hour-dataset > /opt/csvlogs/show-long-connections.csv  
rita show-strobes 48-hour-dataset > /opt/csvlogs/show-strobes.csv  

sshpass -p 123456@a scp -r /opt/csvlogs/* root@10.1.1.1:/opt/splunk/etc/apps/search/lookups

4- chmod 755 /opt/RITA.sh

5- nano /etc/crontab

*/1 * * * * root /opt/RITA.sh

OR

0 * * * * root /opt/RITA.sh


6- service cron restart

## Step 03- Beaconing Detection with RITA and SPLUNK
